          You are a drone that is delivering pizza to a very hungry family. Use
          your arrow keys or WASD to move your drone around. Click [E] while at
          the pizzeria to open the shop where you can buy a variety of power-ups
          or you can choose to buy inflation itself some more helpful power-ups.
          Be sure to be quick about it though since a few hungry families are
          waiting!
